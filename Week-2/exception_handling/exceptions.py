# ðŸ”¸ 1. What is an Exception?
# An exception is a runtime error that disrupts the normal flow of your Python program. 
# For example, dividing by zero or trying to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist.


# ðŸ”¸ 2. Why Handle Exceptions?
# Without handling exceptions:

# Your program crashes

# Users see ugly error messages

# You can't control error flow

# Instead, use try...except to gracefully handle these situations.

# try:
#     with open("data.txt") as f:
#         print(f.read())
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("File does not exist.")



# try:
#     num = int(input("Enter number: "))
#     print(100 / num)
# except ValueError:
#     print("That's not a valid number.")
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("Cannot divide by zero.")
