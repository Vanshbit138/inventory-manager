## 📅 Week 3: Object-Oriented Design

**Branch**: `feat/week-3` → `develop`

### Goals Achieved
- ✅ Refactored to Object-Oriented Programming
- ✅ Implemented inheritance hierarchy
- ✅ Applied SOLID principles
- ✅ Added data validation with Pydantic

### Architecture Overview
```
inventory_manager/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization
├── core.py             # InventoryManager class
├── models.py           # Product hierarchy
└── utils.py            # Utility functions
```

### Class Hierarchy
```python
Product (Base Class)
├── FoodItem
├── ElectronicItem  
└── BookItem
```

### SOLID Principles Applied

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- `core.py`: Inventory management logic only
- `models.py`: Data models and validation only
- `utils.py`: Utility functions only

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Easy to extend with new product types
- Core logic remains unchanged when adding features

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All product subclasses can replace base Product class

### Technical Improvements
- **Pydantic Integration**: Type-safe data validation
- **Error Logging**: Structured logging system
- **Report Generation**: Automated low-stock reports
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, testable code

### Data Validation Example
```python
# Automatic validation with Pydantic
product = FoodItem(
    product_id=101,
    product_name="Milk",
    price=45.0,
    quantity=20,
    expiry_date="2025-08-30"
)
```

## 📅 Week 4: Test-Driven Development

**Branch**: `feat/week-4` → `develop`

### Goals Achieved
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Achieved almost 99% test coverage
- ✅ Applied TDD methodology
- ✅ Used advanced pytest features

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── conftest.py                     # Shared fixtures
├── test_core.py                   # Core functionality tests
├── test_models.py                 # Model validation tests
├── test_models_using_fixtures.py  # Fixture-based tests
└── test_utils.py                  # Utility function tests
```

### TDD Approach: Red-Green-Refactor

1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Advanced Testing Techniques

**Fixtures for Setup/Teardown**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_inventory_data():
    return [
        {"product_id": 1, "name": "Milk", "quantity": 20},
        {"product_id": 2, "name": "Laptop", "quantity": 5}
    ]
```

**Parametrized Tests**
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("quantity,expected", [
    (5, True),   # Low stock
    (15, False), # Normal stock
])
def test_is_low_stock(quantity, expected):
    assert is_low_stock(quantity) == expected
```

**Mocking External Dependencies**
```python
@patch('inventory_manager.core.logging')
def test_logging_behavior(mock_logging):
    # Test logging without actual file I/O
    process_inventory()
    mock_logging.error.assert_called_once()
```

### Testing Achievements
- **100% Coverage**: All code paths tested
- **Mock Usage**: External dependencies isolated
- **Parametrization**: Efficient test case coverage
- **Fixture Usage**: Clean, reusable test setup
